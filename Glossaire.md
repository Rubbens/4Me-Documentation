|Net-centric|	Participating as a part of a continuously-evolving, complex community of people, devices, information and services interconnected by a communications network to achieve optimal benefit of resources and better synchronisation of events and their consequences. (Wikipedia)|
|Network Operations Plan|	The Network Operations Plan is a set of collaborative applications providing access to traffic demand, airspace and airport capacity and constraints and scenarios to assist in managing diverse events. The aim of the NOP is to facilitate the processes needed to reach agreements on demand and capacity.|
|Operating Environment|	An environment with a consistent type of flight operations.|
|Operational Concept|	A proposed system in terms of the user needs it will fulfil, its relationship to existing systems or procedures and the ways it will be used.

|Performance-Based Navigation|	Area navigation based on performance requirements for aircraft operating along an ATS route, on an instrument approach procedure or in a designated airspace.|
|Pop Up Flights|	Flights which are added into the sequence, and thus have delay and XMAN advisories assigned to them, only when they get airborne and not before due lack of accurate data|
|Pre-Planned Departures	Flights where ACDM / DPI information available thus could be added into the sequence before departure|
|Queue Management	|The tactical establishment and maintenance of a safe, orderly and efficient flow of traffic. It includes the handling of queues, both in the air and on the ground. It operates on individual flights and is closely related to, and sometimes indistinguishable from, the Separation Provision process. It aims to facilitate the highest achievable capacity of the ATM System and to manage delays in a fuel-efficient and environmentally acceptable manner.|
|Reference Business Trajectory|	The business trajectory which the airspace user agrees to fly and the ANSP and Airports agree to facilitate (subject to separation provision). Most times indicated in the RBT are estimates, some may be target times (TTA) to facilitate planning and some of them may become constraints (CTA, CTO) to assist in queue management when appropriate, e.g. at XMAN/AMAN horizon.|
|Required Navigation Performance|	A statement of the navigation performance necessary for operation within a defined airspace.

The goal is a synchronised European ATM system where partners are aware of the business and operational situations and collaborate to optimise their operations.|
|Top of Descend|	The Top of Descend is the computed transition from the cruise phase of a flight to the descend phase, the point at which the planned descent to final approach altitude is initiated.
|Trajectory Based Operations|	SESAR Trajectory-based Operations focuses on a further-evolved flight efficiency, predictability and environment and adds capacity. The goal is a trajectory-based ATM system where partners optimise “business and mission trajectories” through common 4D trajectory information and user defined priorities in the network.|

|Traffic Metering|	Traffic metering is the process of organising aircraft into a flow of aircraft with a specific rate.|
|Traffic Sequencing|	Traffic sequencing is the process of organising aircraft into a specific order.|
|Vectoring|Air traffic controllers may have to vector aircraft on their course, e.g. in the frame of a tactical intervention involving a deviation from the planned route for safety reasons, or in a more systematic way – as is often the case in terminal airspace, to sequence aircraft towards the runway(s). Open-loop vectors, as opposed to closed-loop vectors, correspond to the case when no indication is given as to the duration or limit of the ATC vector instruction, nor how the aircraft will re-join its initial route. Typically, a simple heading instruction is an open-loop vector, while a “Direct-to” instruction is a closed-loop vector. Throughout this document, the term vectoring without additional indication refer to open-loop vectors.|
|XMAN|	Cross Border Arrival Management (or Extended Arrival Management): Describes the extension of Arrival Management procedures across FIR borders with the help of upgraded AMAN systems and information provision to adjacent ATS units|
